# c2-patch stable noaudio

# removed BASS audio backend for better perf

known - next song crashes game (F6)

Non-Invasive, trimmed down version with only minor tweaks. 

Features
- Adjust FPS
- Adjust Hz
- Toggle Blur
- Toggle Animation
- Toggle Audiosamples (internally renamed from exp-01 [...] to a more meaningful one

Game reads from settings/*.txt

FPS and Hz expects a value starting at 60.
Blur and Animation a value from 0 to 1 (off and on)

Audiosamples need to match the exact oggfile in the cultris2.jar in order to play. Do not change the order unless you want to swap sound effects.
Therefore, if you wanna disable one, just add disabled_ in front of the sample you don't want.

Simplified setup - Win 10 - same goes for linux, just pick the linux setup thingy.
